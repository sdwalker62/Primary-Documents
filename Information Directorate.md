Air Force Research Laboratory – Information Directorate (AFRL/RI)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Fact|Snapshot|
|Headquarters|Rome, New York (Griffiss Business & Technology Park)|
|Heritage|Founded in 1951 as Rome Air Development Center; became “Rome Laboratory” in 1991; folded into AFRL as the Information Directorate (symbol “RI”) in 1997|
|Core mission|“Explore, prototype and demonstrate high-impact, game-changing technologies” in command, control, communications, computers & intelligence (C4I) and cyber to give Airmen and Guardians decision-dominating information advantages|
|Campus|65-acre site, ~882 000 ft² of labs & test facilities plus off-site ranges in Newport & Stockbridge, NY|
|Workforce (FY-23)|~1 200 total (853 government / 361 on-site support), of which ~420 are scientists & engineers (Govt)|
|Current director|Col Greg E. Stevens, Commander, Det 4, AFRL|

  

  

  

  

What the directorate does

  

  

AFRL/RI is one of nine technology directorates inside the Air Force Research Laboratory.  It serves as the Department of the Air Force’s premier lab for information science and technology, covering the full stack from silicon to decision-maker:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Core Technical Competency|What it means to operators|
|Connectivity & Dissemination (CAD)|Resilient, platform-agnostic networking that gets the right data to the right node at the right time|
|Cyber Science & Technology (CYB)|Tools to assure U.S. freedom of maneuver in cyberspace and to deny the same to adversaries|
|Processing & Exploitation (PEX)|Turning big-data ISR streams into real-time insight with neuromorphic, nano- and quantum computing|
|Autonomy, Command & Control & Decision Support (AC2)|AI-driven C2 services for Joint/Combined All-Domain Ops, including multi-agent autonomy at speed and scale|

  

  

  

  

Why it matters right now (2024-25 highlights)

  

  

- Gen-AI for the force — NIPRGPT.  Dark Saber and AFRL/RI built NIPRGPT, the secure generative-AI chatbot now live on the Unclassified network for CAC holders, letting Airmen experiment with coding, writing and knowledge-management tasks inside the enclave.  
- Future Flag CJADC2 experiments.  Starting Aug 2024, RI’s Future Flag series brings 150-plus participants from multiple Services to up-state New York ranges to stress-test multi-domain C2, autonomy and EM-spectrum concepts with real hardware.  
- Quantum leap.  In 2021 the lab was officially designated the Department of the Air Force Quantum Information Science Research Center; it has since opened a new Extreme Computing Facility and, in 2025, fielded an IonQ trapped-ion quantum-networking system for secure networks R&D.  
- Unmanned-air-traffic management (CLUE UTM). RI and Air Mobility Command are proving low-altitude UAS traffic-management software at MacDill AFB, a key enabler for Advanced Air Mobility ops.  
- Next-gen comms.  Recent CRADAs with industry (e.g., Keysight) push sub-terahertz links for 6G-class tactical networking  .

  

  

  

  

  

How AFRL/RI fits into the bigger Air Force ecosystem

  

  

1. Organizational chain: AFRL → Air Force Materiel Command → Department of the Air Force.
2. Role: Provides S&T that feeds Program Executive Offices, MAJCOM innovation cells and combatant-command JADC2 roadmaps.
3. Partnerships: Griffiss Institute & Innovare Advancement Center (academic/industry collaboration), NY state, DARPA, NSA and allies.
4. Outputs: Reference architectures, software prototypes, hardware demonstrators, data sets, and tech transfer to Program of Record offices.

  

  

  

  

  

Bottom line

  

  

The Information Directorate (AFRL/RI)—often called “Rome Lab”—is the Air Force’s hub for turning raw data into decision advantage, spanning resilient networks, cyber offense-defense, AI-driven C2, and cutting-edge computing (neuromorphic to quantum).  Its work underpins initiatives such as Joint All-Domain Command & Control, resilient SATCOM, zero-trust cyber, and the department’s push to weaponize generative AI and quantum technologies for the fight of 2030 and beyond.
