## Danny Stone CM Meeting 
5/12/2025

* Random and inconsistent inputs
	* Barcodes come in everyday (ADVIDS) manually input fields to assign a barcode
	* Proof of concept is random and is as-needed 
		* Completes ~12 proof of concepts in 2 weeks
		* Mainly media/external-hard drives/discs
* Tickets, barcodes, and technical orders
* Weekly statuses
	* No statuses within 3-4 days indicates delinquency
* Has a configuration management plan that is vague and incomplete (WIP)
* RFC is a manual process involving documentation and other artifacts
	* RFC process is through JIRA
	* Requirements come from the program office
	* Integrated program team reviews and approves it before it moves to CM
	* Cyber team validates the CTF and ATO
	* CM provides documentation to the project leads
* Standard is 2-weeks for MTE and 3-weeks for CTE and TE
* Documentation and software issues:
	* Never knows if software is good or bad until an installation attempt is made
	* Requires a reach back to AFRL or OEM for software issues
	* Redlines for installation and test procedure instructions
* Staging reviews is controlled by DCG-X for CTE
	* Most items are on the *confluence page and have to be transferred to PowerPoint* 
* At Robins AFB we do not do a complete process for the staging review
	* Pre-requisite to get into CTE is a staging review which is a multiple stage process
* *CCB chair (Steve Nunn) at DCG-X and Steve Zavatsky is over the reviewal process and might be worth reaching out to*
* *Pull from different sources to compile artifacts and documentation so we can centralize information for the reviewers*
* *Meet with Danny Stone for an observation day*

The Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) program is intended to first augment, then replace, the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program-of-record and will utilize two sets of satellites that provide worldwide initial warning of ballistic missile attacks on the United States using Infrared detection. Next-Gen OPIR GEO (NGG) satellites will have a Geosynchronous Earth Orbit with coverage around the equator. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the NGG Space vehicles with Raytheon as a subcontractor for the satellitesâ€™ payload. Next-Gen OPIR Polar (NGP) will consist of satellites providing infrared coverage of the northern polar region. Northrop Grumman is prime for these satellites with Ball Aerospace providing their payloads.

Gap analyses will be performed to determine the differential between where the SWEG organizations are and where they need to be to perform this workload. This PWS describes the performance objectives and standards expected of the contractor to provide information necessary for SWEG to produce the gap analysis documents.

- Limited to 30 documents (hill)
- 2 contractors
	- Deliver the same number of documents
- Use AI to analyze these documents
- 9 month turn around
- Hard time burning the money
- Still working through the timing
- Go-in 
	- Directorate level
	- Current capabilities vs needed to standup a depot for the software management of the system
	- Assume the directorate has nothing
		- No labs assigned
		- No FTE assigned to the workloads
	- How many sq ft
	- How many work stations
	- How many servers, etc.
- What is a PWS
