==Section 1 should take ~30 minutes without questions==
## History of Technology In The Classroom
### Against the Written Word
- Socrates and Plato expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of writing on learning and memory.
	- **Socrates' View (As Presented By Plato)**
		- *Reliance on External Marks*
			- Socrates argued that reliance on written texts would cause people to cease exercising their memories as they would depend on external marks (written words) rather than recalling information from within themselves.
		- *Appearance vs True Knowledge*
			- Writing, according to Socrates, provides "an elixir not of memory, but of reminiscence". It gives the **appearance** of wisdom without true understanding, as people may read many things without proper instruction and thus appear to know much while actually knowing little.
		- *Passive Learning*
			- Socrates believed that written words are silent and cannot engage in true dialogue. He emphasized the importance of face-to-face discussion and dialective (the exchange of arguments and questions) as the only way to effectively transmit knowledge and foster true learning.
		- The above points can be found in *Phaedrus 274c-275b* where Socrates recounts to Phaedrus the Egyptian legend of Theuth, the god who invented numbers and letters:

> [!NOTE]
> …said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would  take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, “This invention, O king,” said Theuth, “will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.”
> 
> But Thamus replied, “Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another; and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess.
> 
> “For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise.”

- (continued...)
	- **Plato's Views**
		- Plato was a prolific writer, but he did echo many of the sentiments expounded by Socrates' in his dialog with Theuth
			- He worried that the written word could be misunderstood and misused, as is explained in this excerpt from his *Seventh Epistle*

> [!NOTE]
> After much effort, as names, definitions, sights, and other data of sense, are brought into contact and friction one with another, in the course of scrutiny and kindly testing by men who proceed by question and answer without ill will, with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem, and an intelligence whose efforts reach the furthest limits of human powers. Therefore every man of worth, when dealing with matters of worth, will be far from exposing them to ill feeling and misunderstanding among men by committing them to writing…

### Pencils vs Pens
- Pencils were invented in the late 1700s ([source](https://blogs.bl.uk/untoldlives/2019/05/the-history-of-the-pencil.html)) as were immediately useful for subjects such as Mathematics and Physics where and computations were common.
- Teachers originally preferred students to write with pens (except in the subjects like Mathematics) for the following reasons:
	- *Think before you write*
		- Teachers feared that letting students easily correct their work would cause them to not carefully plan ([source](https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/582679)) their responses and thoughts
	- *Evidence vs Effort*
		- Teachers wanted to see false starts so they could diagnose misconceptions. If a mistake disappears under an eraser, the learning trail is lost ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/28/pencil-erasers-devil-children-failure))
	- *Permanence* 
		- Permanence of ink discouraged constant erasing and corrections and was thought to instill care, neatness, and accountability in students

### Typing vs Writing

- Starting in the mid-2000s many educators began steering students toward handwriting instead of typing for retention purposes.
	- *Mueller & Oppenheimer Study*
		- The Mueller study found that students who typed notes verbatim scored lower on conceptual questions than peers who wrote summaries by hand ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24760141/))
	- *Van der Weel & Van der Meer*
		- High density EEG and fMRI studies showed that handwriting activated wider sensorimotor and memory networks than typing, supporting long-term retention claims. ([source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full))
	- *Slow and Deliberate*
		- Handwriting is slower and forces students to sift, summarize, and reorganize ideas which is linked to a more durable "semantic" memory. (*Mueller study*)
		- Typing speed encourages verbatim transcription, which supports a detailed external record but used shallower processing during class.
- ==It should be noted that this debate continues today and is far from settled==

### Introduction of the Web

- *Not Yet Prepared*
	- A study in 1999 in *National Education Statistics* showed that only **one-third** of educators felt "well or very well prepared" to integrate Internet research into lessons. ([source](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2004/2004011.pdf))
- *Credibility and Plagiarism Fears*
	- A 1998 *Technology & Learning* article urged educators to teach "healthy skepticism" because the web was "chock-full of rumors, hoaxes, exaggerations, falsehoods, ruses and scams" and outright challenged whether teachers should accept information students sourced online ([source](https://www1.udel.edu/sine/course/readings/245992.pdf))
	- Greater access to the web alleviated some of these fears as educators became more familiar with the use of online resources. Instead, educators kept whitelist of acceptable websites with reliable and cited information.
- *2012 Preference Flip*
	- A 2012 *Pew* survey of $2,400$ AP and National Writing Project teachers found that $77$% view the web's impact on student research as "mostly positive", yet over $60$ percent still felt the web "distracts more than it helps" and made teaching credibility checks a top classroom priority. ([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2012/11/01/how-teens-do-research-in-the-digital-world/))

### Language Models Are the Next Paradigm Shift

==Key ideas here are that language models are the next paradigm shift in education, and they can be useful if implemented with moderation==
#### Cognitive Development
- High school students are using ChatGPT to draft essays, get feedback, generate ideas, and assist with complex problems. These uses can enhance learning outcomes but may undermine fundamental skills if misused.
- *Skill Development*
	- **Positive**: 
		- Studies have shown that using language models as a writing assistant or feedback tool can improve writing quality. 
		- This is especially apparent for ESL students engaging in content in their non-native language. ESL students showed **significant** gains in academic writing style ([source](https://slejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40561-024-00295-9#:~:text=gap,of%20ChatGPT%20on%20various%20specific)). 
		- Systematic reviews also report that language models enhance writing efficiency and even sparks creativity by helping with idea generation and organization ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y#:~:text=Mai%20et%20al,content%20accuracy%2C%20and%20facilitates%20collaboration)). Specifically in the High School setting, early evidence of language model adoption shows improvement in students essay quality by providing examples and suggestions, strengthening their grammar, vocabulary, and structure ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=Mai%20et%20al,content%20accuracy%2C%20and%20facilitates%20collaboration)).
	- **Negative**
		- Educators rightly worry that if students do not complete their own work and rely on language models they may not develop their own writing and thinking skills ([source](https://www.learning.com/blog/chat-gpt-classroom/#:~:text=The%20introduction%20of%20ChatGPT%20into,and%20fostering%20creativity%20among%20students)). Experimental studies provide evidence of this claim. One study found that High School students who used language models for help ended up with **reduced** creative writing abilities compared to those who wrote without it ([source](https://www.learning.com/blog/chat-gpt-classroom/#:~:text=The%20introduction%20of%20ChatGPT%20into,and%20fostering%20creativity%20among%20students)). 
		- Another study found that students using language models for assignments had **lower** learning performance and self-efficacy than a control group, suggesting that over-reliance can hinder skill growth ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=showed%20that%20the%20use%20of,compared%20to%20the%20control%20group)).
		- There is also evidence that language models struggle with complex reasoning, so students depending on them might get poor training in solving higher-order problems ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=reliant%20on%20technology%2C%20and%20can,%28%2098)) ([source](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking)).
- *Critical Thinking and Problem Solving*
	- **Positive**
		- Language models can engage students in debates and "what-if" questions that develop critical thinking skills. As a "learning partner", language models can ask probing questions and offer counterarguments, encouraging students to evaluate information critically rather than memorize facts ([source](https://bitpinas.com/ai/regulators-chatgpt-education/#:~:text=The%20same%20idea%20was%20presented,help%20students%20enhance%20critical%20thinking)). 
		- An effective technique is to have students use language models to brainstorm solutions, this shifts the focus toward **mastering the process** instead of just getting answers ([source](https://ehe.osu.edu/news/listing/3-ways-use-chatgpt-help-students-learn-and-not-cheat#:~:text=Treating%20ChatGPT%20as%20a%20learning,performance%20to%20collaboration%20and%20mastery)). 
		- A meta-analysis of controlled studies likewise indicated moderate improvements in higher-order thinking skills (analysis, evaluation, etc.) when language models are integrated with proper guidance ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=learning%20performance%2C%20learning%20perception%2C%20and,performance%20was%20moderated%20by%20type)). 
	- **Negative**
		- Language models provide students with an easy method of cheating or plagiarism, which inhibit major cognitive development, short circuiting the learning process. The lower barrier to cheating via means of essay generation and homework answer generation has led to increases in academic dishonesty ([source](https://www.learning.com/blog/chat-gpt-classroom/#:~:text=However%2C%20critics%20worry%20that%20the,produced%20work%20as%20their%20own)). By submitting language model created homework students forego the critical thinking and writing practice they would get by doing the assignment themselves. 
		- It has also become increasingly difficult to detect language model generated content in an academic setting ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10670526/#:~:text=information%20%28i,by%20ChatGPT%20may%20result%20negatively)). Frequent use of language model generated content stalls skill development and can create a habit of shortcut-seeking over effortful learning. $1$ in $4$ U.S. K-$12$ teachers caught a student using a service like ChatGPT to cheat within months of its release ([source](https://bitpinas.com/ai/regulators-chatgpt-education/#:~:text=The%20term%20responsible%20was%20highlighted,com)). This might create an unfair academic environment, which can breed resentment or skepticism in the classroom. For instance, teachers might become more suspicious of well-polished assignments, which can strain the typically supportive student-teacher relationship. Honest students might feel pressured to similarly cheat, encouraged by seeing the positive benefits yielded by their peers. This can yield increased social friction with teachers enforcing more draconian rules around language model use and students being less open with teachers and peers on how they completed assignments.  
- *Inhuman Tutoring*
	- **Positive**
		- Language models can act as on-demand tutors, providing instant explanations an answers tailored to the student's needs. This allows students to explore information at their own pace. 
		- Language models can breakdown difficult problems step-by-step and provide hints, mimicking the guidance of a paid one-on-one tutor which would beforehand be locked to only those with the means to acquire such things. Language models can therefore help teach a student *how to learn* by providing an interface where they can submit questions without fear of ridicule and embarrassment. 
		- This one-on-one setting can improve learning outcomes and efficiency, especially when combined with curriculum goals and expected outcomes ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=learning%20performance%2C%20learning%20perception%2C%20and,0.001%29%3B%20and%20its)).
	- **Negative**
		- On the other hand language models can hallucinate and provide incorrect information to a student that does not have the cognitive means to validate. If students absorb these misconceptions it can be incredibly difficult to unroot them and correct learning. Language models can often produce plausible sounding misinformation that will confuse and mislead new learners ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=However%2C%20ChatGPT%20has%20also%20been,and%20hinder%20the%20development%20of)). 
		- Over reliance on language models can also encourage shallow learning where student's copy and paste answers without understanding content or context. This can hinder the development of independent research and study skills. 
		- In addition to this, language models contain inherent biases which contaminate their answers and solutions, leading to students receiving partial truths or incorrect framing.

#### Social Development: Collaboration and Communication

- *Facilitating Collaboration and Group Work*
	- **Positive**
		- When integrated into group work, language models can act as a neutral facilitator or "team member" that boosts overall collaboration. 
		- In one classroom experiment, Middle School students working in small groups reported that language models improved collaboration ([source](https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/12/04/ai-in-education-chatgpt-for-kids/#:~:text=Galguera%20and%20Schaeffer%20will%20write,the%20way%20students%20worked%20together)). The model could answer routine questions and generate ideas, which removed some misunderstandings among peers and helped the group focus on problem solving. The teachers observed that the language models added a layer of neutrality, allowing students to spend more time taking in new information than arguing with one another. Although it should be noted that argumentation can be an effective form of learning and thought correction, and as such language models have been effectively used as a debate sparring partners. Language models can allow more timid students to actively engage in new content without the confrontation sometimes present in peer debates and discussions. 
	- **Negative**
		- Discussing new ideas and concepts with a faceless entity such as a language model could reduce the perceived importance of face-to-face interactions. Initial reviews have warned that heavy use of language models could decrease teacher-student and student-student communication ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=several%20shortcomings%2C%20such%20as%20generating,%282023%29%2C%20through%20a)). For example a student might opt to consult a language model for guidance rather than a trained professional, leading to potential confusion and misguidance. 
		- Students might develop a preference for working alone with a language model rather than in groups with peers, eroding teamwork and communication skills. A literature review found that over-reliance on language models tended to make students less engaged in peer learning and group activities, as they felt the AI could do the work for them ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=reliant%20on%20technology%2C%20and%20can,%28%2098)). This stunts the development of social skills like negotiation, empathy, and leadership that typically grow through group projects and classroom discussions in adolescence. 
- *Improved Communication Skills*
	- **Positive**
		- Language models offer students the chance to practice communicating in foreign languages that may otherwise be locked behind paid tutors and courses. Language models offer the chance for learners to engage in conversation in realistic dialogues, helping them practice speaking and writing. The language model provides instant feedback on grammar and word selection. This can boost the student's confidence in using the new language. 
		- This interactive practice is especially beneficial to students who are shy and hesitate to speak up in front of their peers. 
- *Inclusive Participation
	- **Positive**
		- Making a language model tutor available to each student can help equalize participation. In a traditional classroom setting not every student gets their question answered. Language models present a tool that a student can query anytime, allowing them to explore topics when the motivation hits. 
		- Since the language models are mostly judgment-free, the students are more comfortable engaging with content and material at their own level without the feeling of being left behind their peers ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10670526/#:~:text=comments%20on%20research%20articles%20and,It%20might%20additionally%20be)). 
- *Isolation*
	- **Negative**
		- In some cases, students can become so accustomed to interacting with an AI tool that they neglect building the skills required to navigate social contexts, leading to overall social skill deficits overtime. Psychologists note that while language models can serve as convenient conversational partners, they do not cultivate emotional nuance or genuine interpersonal connections ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=reliant%20on%20technology%2C%20and%20can,%28%2098)). If a teen does most of their active participation in learning with a language model, they might become less practiced in collaborating or communicating with real people.

#### Emotional Development

- *Increased Motivation and Engagement*
	- **Positive**
		- Several studies and expert accounts suggest that using language models can make learning more engaging for students. By providing instant help and interactivity, language models tend to capture student's interest and keep them engaged ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=learning%20performance%2C%20learning%20perception%2C%20and,performance%20was%20moderated%20by%20type)).  A meta-analysis of 51 studies found that language model use had a large positive effect on overall student learning performance and a moderate positive effect on students learning perception (their feeling of being supported in learning). High schoolers often respond well to the chat-based format, making their learning feel more game-like. 
		- The language model can help overcome roadblocks and barriers on the learning journey which in turn makes students more likely to persist rather than give up. In fact, some research even noted that AI-assisted learning improved students' intrinsic motivation. They enjoyed learning for its own sake more when an AI tool was part of the learning process. This is in part because language models reduced student anxiety when engaging with difficult content and subject matter ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10670526/#:~:text=Self%20Confidence%20%28ST%2C%20FC%29%20,confidence)) since the language model handled such content in a judgement free manner. One qualitive study found that students valued how language models let them experiment and ask any question privately, which in turn built their self-efficacy in mastering content. Educators at the Ohio State University argue that AI tools offer "opportunities to experience success" by helping students break down complex tasks so students feel a series of small wins instead of one large challenge ([source](https://ehe.osu.edu/news/listing/3-ways-use-chatgpt-help-students-learn-and-not-cheat#:~:text=Research%20shows%20that%20when%20students,with%20opportunities%20to%20experience%20success)). The language model can be prompted to respond with gentle encouragement, making students feel supported. This kind of empathetic feedback, even if coming from a non-human entity, can reinforce a student's confidence and willingness to try again.
	- **Negative**
		- Moderate use can encourage and motivate, overuse can form dependencies. Psychologists warn that over-reliance on AI may diminish student's motivation over time ([source](https://nhsjs.com/2024/examining-the-effects-of-chatgpt-integration-on-ap-english-writing-proficiency-in-williamson-county-high-school-students-a-qualitative-survey-based-study/#:~:text=Zana%20Bu%C3%A7inca%20conducted%20a%20study,of%20the%20depth%20or%20quality)). Over reliance can lead to a learned helplessness as their motivation to exert effort waned because AI was performing the intellectual heavy lifting.
		- Using AI tools to solve tough problems can rob students of the satisfaction of tackling difficult problems on their own, leading to an erosion in their self-discipline and intrinsic drive.
		- Over-reliance on language models for support might mean some students miss out on developing emotional connections with their mentors and peers. Such human connections are important for motivation and confidence. 
		- If a student starts preferring AI feedback over human feedback, this could hamper emotional growth, making it harder for them accept real human criticism or praise in the future ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04787-y?error=cookies_not_supported&code=61fd536f-f486-4ac8-931c-7fe5c84ce461#:~:text=reliant%20on%20technology%2C%20and%20can,%28%2098)).
