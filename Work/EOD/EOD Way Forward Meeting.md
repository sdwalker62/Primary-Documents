- Got a call after the JCCB.
	- How can fast can the 577th pivot if there is a go order for more work.
	- They were also surprised that we only have one guy working the effort when there are three funding slots.
- The PMO confidence in the new AIML feature (security classification) is low
	- They have confidence in Gary to execute what he says, but do not have the same level of confidence in us
- Justin is the front facing person on the AIML side
- We have face roadblocks such as:
	- Hardware in higher environments
	- Security concerns around models
	- Most development is on NIPR, how do we move up the classification chain?

> CJ could potentially move to being the PM over AIML efforts to take the load off of Justin

- Do a KANBAN board for prototyping
