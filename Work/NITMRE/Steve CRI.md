# Contribution

Steve researched and developed categories that define emerging situations that are of interest to the 618th/TACC. Afterwards, he researched the individual words that uniquely identified each category in conjunction with feedback from the customer. Using this information, he used Mattermost chats from NITMRE, generating potentially multiple labels per message that were then confirmed with our in-production Large Language Model. The labeling methodology was developed bespoke for this problem, which included the construction of special prompts for each associated category. Once a message is confirmed to be part of an identified category, it is relayed to the user via a special Mattermost channel.
# Result

The feature was developed ahead of schedule and successfully pushed to our production environment. The feature has been running continuously without error for a few days. We anticipated that the deliverable would take roughly 3 months to research and design, but was completed in 2 months. 
# Impact

The customer is ecstatic with the deliverable and the value it provides. The customer used the term "cash money" and "I will slam my hand on the table for that". The customer has re-prioritized current NLP requirements due to the value proposition of the new feature. Emerging situations provides the AOC with real-time feedback on developing situations that require administrative attention or that require leadership input. It pulls not only from user chat data, but also plane data through ACAR messages.
