### NITMRE Dev Meeting & C2 Meeting
#2025-03-05 #NITMRE

* Too short of an interval returns an error
* There is an upper limit (model has a 128k token context window)
	* Like a human too much information leads to poorer summaries
* Performs better on mission channels with a unifying narrative
	* Seems reliable up to ~20 threads
* Not yet connected to acronym database
* Inquire during meeting about a 1-2 sentence summary of an individual who joins a channel to provide an overview of that person. See if that aligns with MIT/LL research objectives.
	* Don't want to double ping
	* Can we intercept the join message
	* Want a more active role in MIT/LL research 
	* What is the status of user profiling?
* ==Courtland: User profiling is not in a great place==
	* Database of users that marks them as a pilot or not a pilot
	* Used high school students to identify physics experts (wraps up April 17th)
	* Will share the dataset for identified pilots with us
