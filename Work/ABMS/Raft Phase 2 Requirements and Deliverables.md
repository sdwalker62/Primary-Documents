- Dr. Stringer is attending the DASH event in-person.
	- amanda.szczublewski@us.af.mil is the POC for that effort and event
- Going to talk today about what we are hoping to get out of this and craft open requirements and deliverables
	- Nick reached out to Lt. Bean (sp?) and she responded
		- Pete is Nick's finance guy
	- C3BM matched money from AFRL(?) (~a few hundred k).
		- We are not sure that we are able to get that money again
		- Because of this we might need to descope our efforts
		- RAFT comes back with a list of COA given the provided funding and the CBC2 team chooses which one the want to pursue
			- RAFT is relatively hands-off
		- That will likely fund a single person for a few months at most
- We will be operating at the CUI level
- Need to identify what an anomaly is before we can start tracking them!
