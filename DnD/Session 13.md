## Prelude

- We decided to move to the fountain
- Since the remaining gods are growing stronger when we rid the corruptions of the kin we chose to save Khorne for last since we know how to fight him best.
## Fountain Riddle
- We answered two riddles (the answers were leviathan and dreadnaught) unlocking a path under the fountain.
- Inside was a large dreadnaught that is inactive
	- He was hooked up to generators that are keeping the suit powered
	- Life-support systems show that the entity inside is still alive but not active
	- Would take days to re-activate
	- The entity experienced a warp accident that caused it to hurdle toward a planet.
	- Came from 10k years ago
	- People built around the dreadnaught
	- The group decided to invest 3 days reviving the dreadnaught
		- The first day was a success (2 degrees of success)
		- The next two required fate points
		- Installed weapon upgrades and a vox module

## Docks and Underwater Psych
- We decided to head north with *Levy* our new companion to investigate the underwater presence 
- I created breathing apparatuses for us to go underwater
- We grab a boat and head to the middle of the lake
- While traveling we were ambushed by agents of Tzeentch, we had to fight
-
