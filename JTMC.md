|Aspect|What it is / does|
|Role inside ABMS|JTMC is a software “bridge” service that lets the Air Force’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) exchange fire-control-quality target tracks with other Services’ command-and-control networks. It ingests sensor data, performs track-to-track correlation, assigns reporting responsibility (R²), and publishes a single composite track so that any sensor can cue any shooter.|
|Who built it|Developed and matured by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) with Service partners; now field-tested by the ABMS Cross-Functional Team, Army Integrated Air & Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS), Navy Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), and USMC G/ATOR communities.|
|How it works|1. Translates protocols between dissimilar fire-control networks (CEC, IFCN/IBCS, Air Force Link-16, etc.).2. Correlates tracks in real time and preserves high-accuracy “sensor-quality” data.3. Distributes the composite track over tactical data links and ABMS edge nodes so every Service sees the same picture and can engage.|
|Why it matters|• Eliminates stovepipes, giving commanders a fast, joint kill chain.• Enables right-sensor/right-shooter pairing for cruise-missile defense, homeland defense, and expeditionary operations.• Lets legacy systems participate in ABMS/JADC2 without a full software rewrite.|
|Proof points|• Valiant Shield 22: JTMC links the Army’s IFCN/IBCS to the Navy’s CEC so forces across Guam, Palau, and CONUS could “find-fix-track-target-engage” the same simulated threats.  • White Sands ’21 test: JTMC + an Open Systems Gateway let Marine G/ATOR radar and two F-35s feed a Patriot battery that shot down a cruise-missile target while under jamming—first true cross-Service, fire-control-quality intercept.|

  

Bottom line

  

  

JTMC is the track-translation and correlation layer inside ABMS. By turning many disparate sensor/fire-control networks into one sharable track picture, it unlocks the core ABMS promise of rapid, joint, all-domain command and control.
