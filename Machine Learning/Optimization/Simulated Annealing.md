Simulated Annealing steals an idea from Physics. When external conditions allow molecules to be mobile and then the mobility of molecules is slowly reduced through cooling, the molecules then arrange themselves into the lowest energy configuration.

## Notes

* In Simulated Annealing, high temperature equates to more randomness. Gradual cooling will reduce the randomness until we converge on a solution.
