### Strengths

- **Bias reduction**: By sequentially focusing on the mistakes of prior weak learners, AdaBoost drives down training bias and often yields a highly accurate strong classifier.
- **Theoretical guarantees**: Under mild assumptions it can be shown that training error decreases exponentially with the number of rounds, and margins on the data tend to grow—both linked to good generalization.
- **Flexibility in base learners**: You can plug in any weak learner (decision stumps, small trees, linear models), making AdaBoost broadly applicable.
- **Automatic feature weighting**: Examples that are hard to classify get higher weights, effectively guiding the model to pay more attention to informative, difficult regions of the input space.
- **Resistance to overfitting (in low-noise settings)**: Remarkably, even as you add more weak learners, test error often continues to improve or plateaus rather than rising, provided label noise is minimal.

### Weaknesses

- **Sensitivity to noisy data and outliers**: Because it up-weights misclassified points, noisy labels or outliers can disproportionately distort the ensemble, leading to poorer generalization.
- **Dependency on weak-learner quality**: If your base learner is too weak (e.g. stumps on overly complex data) convergence can be slow; if it’s too strong, later rounds add little new information.
- **Imbalanced classes and cost-insensitive**: By default AdaBoost treats all errors equally, so it can struggle when one class heavily outweighs another or when misclassification costs differ.
- **Computational cost**: Training entails re-weighting the entire dataset and retraining the base learner each round; with large datasets or complex weak learners this can be expensive.
- **No direct probability estimates**: The output is a margin score rather than a well-calibrated posterior probability, so you may need additional calibration (e.g., Platt scaling) for probabilistic interpretation.
