### Strengths

- **Computational simplicity & speed**
    - Training reduces to estimating class priors and per-feature likelihoods; prediction is a few multiplies/adds (or sums in log-space).
    - Scales linearly in both number of features and examples, making it ideal for very high-dimensional data (e.g. text).
- **Low data requirements**
    - Because it estimates only univariate feature distributions, it can attain reasonable performance with far fewer examples than fully parameterized models.
- **Built-in regularization via smoothing**
    - Techniques like Laplace (add-one) smoothing guard against zero-frequency issues and overfitting when features are sparse.
- **Interpretability & probabilistic outputs**
    - Yields well-defined class probability estimates (under its model assumptions), which can be calibrated and used in downstream decision making.
        
### Weaknesses

- **Strong conditional-independence assumption**
    - Real-world features (e.g. word co-occurrences, correlated attributes) often violate independence, leading to suboptimal likelihood estimates.
- **Ignores feature interactions**
    - Cannot model synergistic or antagonistic effects between features, so it may misclassify when predictive power lies in combinations rather than marginals.
- **Sensitivity to model misspecification**
    - If true feature distributions differ markedly from assumed (e.g. Gaussian vs. actual heavy-tailed), performance degrades.
- **Probabilities can be poorly calibrated**
    - When independence fails, the posterior probabilities can be over- or under-confident, which may mislead threshold-based decisions.
- **Outperformed by discriminative models with abundant data**
    - Given large labeled datasets, methods like logistic regression or boosted trees often achieve higher accuracy by directly optimizing decision boundaries rather than fitting a generative model.
