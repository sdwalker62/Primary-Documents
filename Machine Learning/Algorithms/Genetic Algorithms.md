| **Global, population-based search**                                                                                                                               |                                            |
| Able to explore multiple regions of the solution space in parallel, reducing the risk of getting stuck in local optima.                                           | **High computational cost**                |
| Evaluating and evolving a whole population over many generations can be expensive, especially if each fitness evaluation is costly.                               |                                            |
| **Gradient-free**                                                                                                                                                 |                                            |
| Need only a fitness (objective) function—no derivatives or continuity assumptions required, so GAs work on discrete, non-differentiable, and even noisy problems. | **Sensitive to hyperparameters**           |
| Performance hinges on choices like population size, mutation/crossover rates, and selection pressure; poor settings often lead to slow convergence or failure.    |                                            |
| **Flexible encoding & hybridization**                                                                                                                             |                                            |
| Chromosome representations can capture complex or problem-specific structures, and GAs readily combine with local search or domain knowledge.                     | **Premature convergence & diversity loss** |
| Without careful diversity maintenance, the population can converge early to suboptimal regions, hindering further exploration.                                    |                                            |
| **Intrinsic parallelism**                                                                                                                                         |                                            |
| Natural fit for distributed or GPU-accelerated implementations, since fitness evaluations and genetic operations on individuals are independent.                  | **No optimality guarantees**               |
| Stochastic nature means there’s no assurance of finding a global optimum; results vary run-to-run and must be validated.                                          |                                            |

In practice, GAs shine when you face rugged, multi-modal landscapes or black-box fitness functions—but they demand careful tuning and often substantial compute to outperform more specialized methods on well-behaved problems.
