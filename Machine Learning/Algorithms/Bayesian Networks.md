### Strengths

- **Explicit Uncertainty Modeling**: BNs encode probabilistic dependencies directly, allowing principled reasoning under uncertainty and support for soft inference (e.g., computing marginal or conditional probabilities given evidence).
- **Modular Representation**: The DAG structure factorizes a high-dimensional joint distribution into smaller, local CPTs. This modularity makes specification and updating of parts of the model (structure or parameters) more manageable.
- **Incorporation of Expert Knowledge**: Domain experts can encode causal or conditional independencies into the graph, guiding both structure and parameter learning, which is especially valuable when data are scarce.
- **Efficient Handling of Missing Data**: BNs can naturally marginalize over unobserved (missing) variables during inference, avoiding ad-hoc imputation.
- **Interpretable Structure**: The graph visualization makes qualitative relationships (e.g., “A influences B”) explicit, aiding communication with stakeholders and supporting causal reasoning (when assumptions hold).
- **Flexible Learning**: Both parameters (CPT entries) and structure (graph edges) can be learned from data (using score-based or constraint-based algorithms), accommodating purely data-driven model construction.

### Weaknesses

- **Inference Complexity**: Exact inference (computing marginals or MAP assignments) is NP-hard in general DAGs; it often requires approximate algorithms (e.g., loopy belief propagation, sampling), which may have no convergence guarantees.
- **Structure Learning Difficulty**: Discovering the optimal DAG is combinatorial and NP-hard; heuristic search or constraint-based methods can get stuck in local optima or require large sample sizes to be reliable.
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: CPT estimates can be unreliable when data are sparse; small errors in probabilities can propagate through the network, degrading inference accuracy.
- **Scalability Limits**: As variable count grows, the size of CPTs (especially for nodes with many parents) can explode, leading to high memory and computational demands.
- **Assumption of Conditional Independence**: BNs rely on the “Markov assumption” encoded by the graph; if true dependencies are omitted or mis-specified, the model can produce misleading inferences.
- **Handling of Continuous Variables**: While you can use conditional linear Gaussian distributions or discretize continuous variables, these approaches introduce modeling challenges and may lose fidelity or tractability.
