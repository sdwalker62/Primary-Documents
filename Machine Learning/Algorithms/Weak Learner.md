### Strengths

- **Simplicity & Speed**: Often based on shallow decision stumps or small trees, weak learners train extremely quickly and require minimal tuning.
- **Low Variance**: Their limited capacity means they’re unlikely to overfit individual datasets, making them stable building blocks in an ensemble.
- **Interpretability**: Each component is so simple that you can inspect exactly how it makes decisions, easing debugging.
- **Ensemble Synergy**: When combined (e.g., via AdaBoost), many weak learners can collectively form a highly accurate, low-bias predictor.

### Weaknesses

- **High Bias**: Individually, they cannot capture complex patterns or interactions in the data, leading to systematic errors.
- **Poor Standalone Performance**: A single weak learner’s accuracy is often too low for practical use—reliance on ensembling is mandatory.
- **Noise Sensitivity**: Because each model is so simple, mistakes on noisy or borderline cases can propagate (though boosting’s reweighting can mitigate this to some extent).
- **Diminishing Returns**: Beyond a point, adding more weak learners yields only marginal gains and may increase computational cost without significant accuracy improvement.
