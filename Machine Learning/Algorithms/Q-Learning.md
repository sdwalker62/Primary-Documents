|**Strengths**|**Weaknesses**|
|---|---|
|• **Model‐free**: Learns directly from experience without requiring a model of the environment.|• **Scalability**: Tabular Q‐learning doesn’t scale to large or continuous state–action spaces.|
|• **Off‐policy**: Can learn optimal policy from arbitrary behavior data (e.g., demonstrations).|• **Sample inefficiency**: Requires a large number of interactions to converge.|
|• **Theoretical convergence**: Under standard assumptions (e.g., sufficient exploration, decaying α), it converges to the optimal Q-function.|• **Function‐approximation challenges**: Combining Q-learning with nonlinear function approximators (e.g., neural nets) can be unstable or diverge.|
|• **Simplicity**: Conceptually straightforward and easy to implement for discrete problems.|• **Exploration sensitivity**: Performance heavily depends on the exploration strategy (e.g., ε-greedy parameters).|
|• **Off‐policy learning reuse**: Experience replay buffers and batch updates improve data efficiency.|• **Delayed credit assignment**: Struggles when rewards are sparse or delayed without additional mechanisms (e.g., eligibility traces).|
