### Strengths

- **Smooth and differentiable**:  The sigmoid is continuously differentiable everywhere, which makes it amenable to gradient‐based optimization methods (e.g., back-propagation).
- **Bounded output (0, 1)**:  Its output lies strictly between 0 and 1, giving it a natural probabilistic interpretation—useful in binary classification and gating mechanisms.
- **Monotonic**:  A strictly increasing mapping preserves order, which can help in certain model‐interpretation contexts.
    
### Weaknesses

- **Vanishing gradients**:  For inputs far from zero, the derivative \sigma{\prime}(z)=\sigma(z)\,(1-\sigma(z)) approaches zero, slowing or stalling learning in deep layers.
- **Non–zero-centered outputs**:  Outputs in (0,1) induce bias shifts in activations of the next layer, which can slow convergence.
- **Computational cost**:  Computing the exponential function is more expensive than simpler activations (e.g., ReLU).
- **Saturation**:  In the “tails,” large positive or negative inputs map to values extremely close to 1 or 0, making the neuron effectively “off” and insensitive to small input changes.
