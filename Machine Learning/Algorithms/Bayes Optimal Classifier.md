### **Strengths**

- **Minimum Expected Error**: Guarantees the lowest possible misclassification rate (Bayes risk) under 0–1 loss, serving as a gold-standard benchmark.
- **Principled Uncertainty Quantification**: Directly yields class posterior probabilities $P(y\mid x)$, enabling calibrated confidence estimates and cost-sensitive decision-making.
- **Flexibility**: Can accommodate any number of classes, loss functions, and prior beliefs by adjusting the posterior thresholding or decision rule.
- **Incorporates Prior Knowledge**: Naturally blends prior class probabilities and evidence from data, which is especially useful when classes are imbalanced or data are scarce.
- **Foundation for Approximate Methods**: Provides theoretical grounding for practical algorithms (e.g., Naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks) that approximate the true distribution.

### **Weaknesses**

- **Intractability in Practice**: Exact computation of the full joint $P(X,Y)$ is typically impossible for high-dimensional or continuous features without strong distributional assumptions.
- **Model Misspecification Sensitivity**: Approximations (e.g., assuming feature independence) can lead to significant performance degradation if assumptions are violated.
- **High Data Requirements**: Reliable estimation of complex multivariate densities demands large, representative datasets; sparse or biased samples yield poor posterior estimates.
- **Computational and Storage Costs**: Storing and querying high-dimensional joint distributions scales poorly, often requiring dimensionality reduction or factorization techniques.
- **Limited Interpretability**: The optimal decision boundary itself may be highly nonlinear or combinatorial, making it hard to interpret or extract simple rules.
