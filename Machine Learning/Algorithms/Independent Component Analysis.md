|**Strengths**|**Weaknesses**|
|---|---|
|- Captures higher-order statistics and non-Gaussian structure- Effective for blind source separation (e.g., EEG, audio)- Fully unsupervisedâ€”no labels required- Mature, fast algorithms exist (e.g., FastICA)|- Assumes statistical independence, which may not hold in practice- Sensitive to noise and outliers- Component scale and ordering are ambiguous (requires post-hoc normalization)- Computational cost grows with dimensionality and sample size|
