### Strengths

- **Non-parametric & flexible**: Can capture complex, non-linear relationships without assuming any specific functional form.
- **Automatically handles interactions**: Splits on different features in sequence, implicitly modeling feature interactions.
- **Robust to outliers in predictors**: A single extreme value only affects splits if it crosses a decision threshold—doesn’t unduly skew the entire model.
- **Easy to visualize and interpret**: The tree structure lends itself to clear, rule-based explanations of predictions.
        
### Weaknesses

- **High variance**: Small changes in data can yield very different trees; prone to overfitting if not pruned or regularized.
- **Bias toward splits on variables with many levels**: Features with more distinct values are more likely to be chosen for splits, even if less predictive.
- **Piecewise-constant predictions**: Outputs are constant within each leaf region, leading to discontinuities and poor extrapolation.
- **Greedy, myopic splitting**: Each split optimizes locally; the global tree may be suboptimal without exhaustive search (infeasible for large problems).
