### Strengths

- **Simplicity & Interpretability**: Builds trees using information gain; resulting models are easy to visualize and explain.
- **Handles Multi-class Targets**: Naturally supports classification into more than two classes without modification.
- **Requires Little Data Preparation**: Works directly with categorical features (continuous attributes can be discretized).
- **Fast Learning**: Greedy, top-down induction makes tree construction relatively efficient for moderate datasets.
- **Non-Parametric**: Makes no assumptions about data distributions.
    
### Weaknesses

- **Overfitting**: Greedy splits can fit noise unless controlled by pruning (ID3 itself has no pruning step).
- **Bias toward Multi-valued Features**: Information gain favors attributes with many distinct values, even if they’re not truly predictive.
- **Requires Discretization of Continuous Features**: Must bin numeric data beforehand, which can lose information or inject arbitrariness.
- **Sensitive to Noisy or Missing Data**: Can produce very different trees from slight variations in the data.
- **Greedy, Local Decisions**: Early split choices can’t be revised later, so suboptimal early splits can harm overall accuracy.
