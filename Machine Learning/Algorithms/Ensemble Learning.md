### Strengths

1. **Improved Predictive Performance**
    - Reduces variance (e.g., via bagging) and/or bias (e.g., via boosting), often outperforming any single base learner.
    - Exploits diverse errors: uncorrelated mistakes tend to cancel out when aggregated.
2. **Greater Robustness**
    - Less sensitive to the idiosyncrasies or overfitting of individual learners.
    - Can handle noisy labels or outliers better than a lone model.
3. **Flexibility and Versatility**
    - Applicable with virtually any learning algorithm (trees, SVMs, neural nets, etc.).
    - Supports heterogeneous ensembles (mixing different model types) for richer representations.
        
### Weaknesses

1. **Increased Complexity**
    - Training and inference require more time and computational resources (especially for large ensembles).
    - Hyper-parameter tuning multiplies: you must tune both base learners and the ensemble method.
2. **Reduced Interpretability**
    - Aggregated decisions obscure which features or patterns individual learners relied on.
    - Harder to explain to stakeholders compared to a single, simple model.
3. **Diminishing Returns**
    - Beyond a certain ensemble size or diversity threshold, additional models yield only marginal gains.
    - Risk of “ensemble overfitting” if models are too similar or if the aggregation method is poorly chosen.
